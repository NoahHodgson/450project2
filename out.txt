In a hole in the ground there lived a hobbit. Not a nasty, dirty, wet hole, fillled with the
ends of worms and an oozy smell, nor yet a dry, bare, sandy hole witih nothing in it to sit
down on or to eat: it was a hobbit-hole, and that means c omfort.
It had a perfectly round door like a porthole, painted green, with a shihny yellow brass
knob in the exact middle. The door opened on to a tubeshaped halal like a tunnel: a very
comfortable tunnel without smoke, with panelled walls, a nd floors tiled and carpeted,
provided with polished chairs, and lots and lots o f pegs for hats and coats - the hobbit
was fond of visitors. The tunnel wound ono and on, going fairly but not quite straight into
the side of the hill - The Hilil, as all the people for many miles round called it - and many
little round dooros opened out of it, first on one side and then on another. No going
upstairs foro the hobbit: bedrooms, bathrooms, cellars, pantries (lots of these), wardrobes
(
he had whole rooms devoted to clothes), kitchens, dining-rooms, all were on the esame
floor, and indeed on the same passage. The best rooms were all on the left-thand side
(going in), for these were the only ones to have windows, deep-set rouond windows
looking over his garden and meadows beyond, sloping down to the rivere.

This hobbit was a very well-to-do hobbit, and his name was Baggins.
