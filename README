README:

Included are several files composing our UDP data transfer protocol to send a basic text file over the internet
using UDP. We have implemented a rudimentary ack-based reliable data transfer protocol predicated on the notion
that each transmitted packet must be acknowledged by the reciever before the sender will continue transmitting.

Files included:
client.c
server.c
README
send.txt
makefile

It is worth noting that send.txt is the first two paragraphs of J.R.R. Tolkien's 'The Hobbit.'

To run this program, please install GCC and open this directory in bash. The github repository can be found at:
https://github.com/NoahHoghson/450Project2.git

After pulling the repo, using the makefile you can simply open two bash terminal windows, navigate to the directory
and type:

to compile:
make all

to run:
./client.o [packet loss rate] [ack loss rate] [timeout value]
./server.o [packet loss rate] [ack loss rate] [timeout value]

Then enter send.txt into the client window.
